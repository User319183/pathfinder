# Roblox Pathfinder Script

Pathfinder is a Roblox Lua script that allows characters to automatically navigate through a series of targets in Roblox games. This script is designed to be run on Roblox script executors.

## Features

- Automatic navigation: Characters will automatically walk to a series of targets.
- Obstacle jumping: Characters will jump over obstacles in their path.
- Customizable settings: You can customize the walking speed, tolerance for reaching targets, and whether characters should stop walking or jump over obstacles.

## Usage

1. Import the script into your Roblox script executor.
2. Customize the `targets` array with the coordinates of your targets.
3. Customize the `settings` table as needed.
4. Execute the script in your desired Roblox game.
